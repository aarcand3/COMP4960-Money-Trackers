Chatbot

    Due to the fact that the chatbot is ran from the personal computer in my home
    it may not be available at all times and thus with return an error to the console
    when tried if the server is not online.
    
    If you would like to test the chatbot and it appears to be offline, please send me an
    email at DonahueJ5@wit.edu or Jackvgbvi@gmail.com
