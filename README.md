# COMP4960-Money-Trackers
The official repository for the expense tracking project for Software Engineering group project.

Today’s financial world is increasingly challenging in the consumer driven market. The average American cannot cover a surprise five hundred dollar expense. 
People are painfully unaware of their personal financial health leaving them in crushing debt from student loans to credit cards.
To help solve this problem me have developed a simple expense tracker to assist people in saving, paying down debt, and budget. 
Our tracker can help assist in choosing which sourse of debt to pay off first based on interest rate, plan savings goals, and more. 
Our GUI is able to take in a CSV file directly or allow structured manual input of data as well as visualise spending with charts.
