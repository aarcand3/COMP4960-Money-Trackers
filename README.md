# COMP4960-Money-Trackers
The official repository for the expense tracking project for Software Engineering group project.

Todayâ€™s financial world is increasingly challenging in the consumer driven market. The average American cannot cover a surprise five hundred dollar expense. People are painfully unaware of their personal financial health leaving them in crushing debt from student loans to credit cards.
Our solution would be to develop an user-friendly expense tracker to assist people with seeing what payments would need to be made and to help users create and stick to a budget they create with our resources. In creating a budget the budget tracker will help assist in choosing which debt they want to pay off first or how much they can contribute to their savings based on the goals that they choose. 
Our GUI will be able to take in a csv file or personal input and categorize to assist in visualising spending and help to create a budget and debt pay off plan.
